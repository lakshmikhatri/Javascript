/* Assignment operator (=)*/
// like x=5
// changing  j=x=40;
/* arithmetic addition 
X=X+Y;
*/
//for example
let x=10,y=17;
//x=x+y;//with arithmetic addition
x+=y;//with addition assignment operator
console.log(x);//print x=2
//subtraction assignment operator 
x-=y;
//multiplication assignment operator
x*=y;
//Division  assignment operator
x/=y;
//Remainder assignment operator
x%=y;
/* bitwise operator*/
//left shift assignmment operator
x<<=y;
//right shift assignmment operator
x>>=y;
//right shift zero fill assignmment operator
x>>>=y
/* bitwise and operator*/
//and (&) assignment operator
x &= y;
//or(|)assignment operator
x |=y;
//xor(^)assignment operator
x ^=y;
//when we are making a thousand lines of code then the short hand opeartor is very helpful to minimise the code 

let x1=10,y1=5;
x1-=y1
console.log(x1);
